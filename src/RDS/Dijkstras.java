/**
 *The Dijkstras class is responsible for the implementation of all of the back-end
 * algorithm related business. It is called Dijkstras because that is the algorithm
 * that is being implemented. This algorithm works with any kind of routing where
 * finding a shortest path between A and B is important. Here it is used to find
 * routes between buildings on Rowan's campus but the same algorithm could be used
 * for computer networking for example.
 *
 * The reason this algorithm works for this particular problem is because since
 * it is based on a pre-calculated map based off of the actual Rowan Campus map,
 * there will be no negative weights or cycles. If this algorithm were to be ported
 * to a different problem set, Bellman-Ford or Djikstra-Scholten or a different
 * path algorithm might have to be implemented.

     * computeRoutes computes all the routes between buildings beginning with a given

     * It also applies the weights to their corresponding edges to
     * allow for calculating a shortest route later on. This method can be thought
     * of as 'connecting-the-dots' on the given map of buildings.
     *
     * The loop that checks distances is essential to the algorithm because it
     * allows for the shortest route to nxt be checked FIRST. If that was not the
     * case a TON of efficiency would be lost. Removing and re-adding nxt insures
     * that the new minDistance is taken into account when analyzing the next round.
